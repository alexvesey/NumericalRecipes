# Numerical Recipes
## Adventues in C and Rust

This Repository is a playground for me to learn both ANSI C and Rust

I will be doing so by following along with the book _Numerical Recepies in C The Art of Scientific Computing Second Edition_

At the beginning of this project (Where we are now) I only have expreience with C++. To learn both languages I will
be following the book and implementing all of the programs in the book as they are given in C. I will then attempt to 
translate these to Rust. An integration and test suite may also come about as a means of comparing the implementations.
